## Instructions
You have been given an unfinished Pokémon battle simulator python script that is capable of running infinite simulations of Pokémon battles. Your goal is to complete the pokemon.py battle script to be able to run battle simulations. This task is broken up into 3 parts which will be described below and are also written out inline with the script.
